# Wedding Planner Relational Database

## Overview
**Wedding Planner Database** is an application designed for the user to keep track of all details of a wedding.

## Intention
This was created as an academic project for CPSC 304. The intent was to learn how to create an efficient database from the overall design and purpose, to the actual code implementation. The steps to complete the project include: ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram design, schema design (derived from the ER diagram), functional dependency design, normalisation of functional dependencies, creating SQL DDL (data-definition language) statements, creating sample SQL INSERT statements, and database GUI and back-end functionality via HTML and PHP.
